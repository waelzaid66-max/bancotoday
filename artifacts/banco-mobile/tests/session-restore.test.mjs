/**
 * Session restore flow — static regression guards.
 *
 * These tests verify the cold-start session restore sequence in Expo Go by
 * asserting that each critical structural property is present in the source.
 * They run in CI (no device/emulator needed) and are the fastest way to catch
 * a regression in the auth / biometric / session restore chain before the app
 * ships.
 *
 * What is validated:
 *  1. tokenCache → Clerk persists tokens to SecureStore so sessions survive
 *     Expo Go being closed and reopened (no re-login prompt for valid sessions).
 *  2. ClerkLoadGate (or legacy ClerkLoaded) → auth-sensitive providers only
 *     render once Clerk has fully resolved the stored session (or after a
 *     timed guest fallback), so `isSignedIn` is never read mid-init.
 *  3. Provider order → AuthGateProvider > SessionProvider > BiometricProvider.
 *     SessionContext calls useAuthGate(), so the gate MUST sit above the
 *     session provider; inverting this creates a context cycle.
 *  4. Biometric hydration gate → an opaque cover is shown during the async boot
 *     window (hardware probe + AsyncStorage read) so a biometric-enabled user
 *     never sees real content before the lock is applied.
 *  5. Guest lock (listing detail) → the catch-all full-screen guest gate fires
 *     only after Clerk has resolved (isLoaded && !isSignedIn), and the fetch
 *     effect early-returns for guests to avoid unauthenticated API calls.
 *  6. Server save reconciliation → only runs when the user is signed in; guests
 *     must never trigger backend calls.
 *
 * Run: pnpm --filter @workspace/banco-mobile run test:session-restore
